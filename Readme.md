# Introduction

This is the ElGamal crypto-system inplementation for my masters at the University of Europe for Applied Scineces, in Germany. The code is splitted into three units, in order ro properly simulate the expected real-world scenario of the ElGamal encryption and decryption concepts. 
The various units are the required algorithm for the following

# Algorithms

1. Key Generation
   - Large prime
   - Primitive roots
   - Public key generation
2. Encryption
   - Secret key generation
   - Encoding
   - Character encryption
3. Decryprion
   - Scret key discovery
   - Decoding 
   - Unicode decryption
